This thesis focuses on fractal geometry with the aim of clearly presenting the fundamental concepts and principles of this branch of mathematics. The main topics include self-similarity,~fractal dimensions (particularly box-counting and Hausdorff dimensions),~measure theory (with emphasis on Hausdorff and Lebesgue measures),~L-systems,~iterated function systems (IFS),~and Time Escape algorithms,~particularly those related to Julia and Fatou sets.

The thesis is designed to accommodate readers of varying mathematical proficiency. Basic principles are explained in Chapters 1,~4,~and 5,~while Chapter 2 provides a~detailed mathematical analysis of measure theory and dimensions. Practical aspects and algorithms used for fractal generation are described in Chapter 5,~emphasizing general comprehensibility,~allowing the reader to understand and apply the discussed methods without prior knowledge of a~specific programming language.

An essential component of the thesis includes illustrations primarily created using the Ipe drawing editor and accompanying fractal generation software,~which is available on the GitHub platform.
