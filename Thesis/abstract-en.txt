This thesis focuses on fractal geometry with the aim of clearly presenting the fundamental concepts~and principles of this branch of mathematics. The main topics include self-similarity, fractal dimensions (particularly box-counting~and Hausdorff dimensions), measure theory (especially with emphasis on Hausdorff~and Lebesgue measures), L-systems, iterated function systems (IFS), and Time Escape algorithms, particularly those related to Julia~and Fatou sets.

The thesis is designed to accommodate readers of varying mathematical proficiency. Basic principles are explained in Chapters~1,~4, and~5, while Chapter~2 provides a~detailed mathematical analysis of measure theory~and dimensions. Practical aspects~and algorithms used for fractal generation are described in Chapter~5, emphasizing general comprehensibility, allowing the reader to understand~and apply the discussed methods without prior knowledge of a~specific programming language.

An important part of this thesis are the illustrations created mainly in Ipe~and using the accompanying fractal generation software developed for this thesis, which is available on GitHub.
